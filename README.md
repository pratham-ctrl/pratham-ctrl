  <summary>🔽 Click to expand — My AI/ML Journey</summary>

I began my journey by creating small ML models and tools to solve problems I faced daily — from transaction analysis to recommendation systems.  
Over time, these experiments grew into complete projects involving Random Forests, KNN sentiment prediction, Apriori-based recommendations, and end-to-end analytical dashboards.

Open-source has become a way for me to document my learning, stay consistent, and share my progress with others.
