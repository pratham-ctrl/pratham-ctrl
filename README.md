## 👋 Hi, I'm Pratham

I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Python Developer who builds practical tools, automation scripts, and real-world machine learning applications. Most of these projects began as solutions to problems I faced — now shared openly in case they help others.

<details>
  <summary>🔽 Click to expand — My AI/ML Journey</summary>

I started by building small ML models and tools to solve everyday problems — from transaction analysis to recommendation systems. Over time, these grew into end-to-end projects involving Random Forests, KNN sentiment prediction, Apriori-based recommendations, and automation pipelines.

Open-source is my way to record progress, share what I learn, and collaborate with others.
