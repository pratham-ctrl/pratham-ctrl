### 🌱 About Me

I'm an **AI/ML Engineer** and **Python Developer** focused on building practical tools, automation scripts, and end-to-end machine learning applications.

Most of my projects began as solutions to actual problems I faced—now shared openly to help others. I enjoy experimenting with models, building backend pipelines, and shipping useful tools.

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** AI Humanizer & Fraud Detection Systems.
* 🧠 **Interests:** AI/ML Engineering, Backend Systems (FastAPI), and Automation.
* 💡 **Philosophy:** Build it, break it, fix it, ship it.

### 🧩 What I Build

I build intelligent systems, experiment with machine learning, and automate boring tasks. Here is what I work on:

* 🤖 **AI/ML projects:** End-to-end pipelines and model integration.
* 🛡️ **Fraud detection systems:** Real-time analysis and prediction.
* 💳 **Credit card expense tools:** Finance tracking and management solutions.
* 📱 **Automation utilities:** APK analysis scripts and ADB automation.
* 🚀 **Apps:** Full-stack Streamlit & Flutter applications.

<summary><b>🔽 Click to expand — My AI/ML Journey</b></summary>
<br>
I started by building small ML models and tools to solve everyday problems — from transaction analysis to recommendation systems.

Over time, these grew into end-to-end projects involving:
* Random Forests
* KNN sentiment prediction
* Apriori-based recommendations
* Automation pipelines

Open-source is my way to record progress, share what I learn, and collaborate with others.
